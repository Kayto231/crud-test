I haven't worked properly on css because i didn't really have a scheme to work with. I also haven't implemented stuff related to comments. If to be honest i just did't realize what i need to do with them.
What about refactoring of the project. There are a lot of stuff to do. I would actually better rework modal windows in way of making one modal and just setting it info with props or taking from global state. But i am lack of experince at the moment so i that's why i didn't do it in time.
